# Cursor AI / LLM editing rules for this repo

You are operating in a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. Follow these rules:

- Keep diffs minimal and focused on the task.
- Maintain TypeScript strictness and existing tsconfig inheritance.
- Use internal workspace deps with version "workspace:*".
- UI components live in packages/ui with Tailwind utility classes.
- Do not add new tooling or frameworks without explicit instruction.
- Run and respect: pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint, pnpm build.
- Prefer adding small utilities to packages/utils and types to packages/types.
- Avoid editing CI unless required by the change.
- Never commit secrets or .env files.
- Update docs (AGENTS.md or /docs) when adding packages or public APIs.
