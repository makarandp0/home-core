# Cursor rules (minimal, DRY)

Canonical sources
- `README.md`: commands, scripts, and environment usage.
- `AGENTS.md`: operator/LLM workflow, constraints, and repo conventions.

Editing guardrails
- Keep diffs minimal; change only what’s required for the task.
- Follow monorepo patterns; use internal deps as `"workspace:*"`.
- Maintain TypeScript strictness; don’t add tools/frameworks without instruction.
- Run and respect: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`.
- Update docs only when adding packages or public APIs; link back to `README.md`/`AGENTS.md` (don’t duplicate).

Conflict resolution
- Prefer `README.md` for commands/scripts and `AGENTS.md` for process/policy.
